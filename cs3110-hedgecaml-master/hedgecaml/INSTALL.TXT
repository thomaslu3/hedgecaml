Make sure that you are in the hedgecaml 
directory and run "make play". Terminal must be in full screen.

The command line will then ask you if you would like to load a saved game.
If you type "y" and there is a saved game, the saved game will resume.
Otherwise you will be told that no saved file has been found and 
rerouted to the same prompt. If you type "n" you will be prompted with
difficulties (easy, medium, hard, and sandbox) that vary the amount of money
you are trying to earn in 100 rounds (for easy, medium, and hard) or the 
number of rounds you can play for (infinitely many for sandbox).

Once you have entered the game, you can type the command [help] to get a list
of commands and descriptions. The commands are described below as well.
